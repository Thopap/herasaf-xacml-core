/**
 * The PDP interface represents a core component in XACML - The Policy Decision Point.<br />
 * A PDP is responsible for evaluating authorization requests against the deployed policies from a PolicyRepository. <br />

 * The PDP evaluates a request ({@link RequestCtx}) against all policies retrieved from the Policy Repository, evaluates
 * them and returns a response inlcuding the decision <br />
 * It can use a PIP (Policy Information Point) if missing attributes should be resolved during evaluation.<br />
 * A PDP has a root Policy Combining Algorithm configured that is responsible for combining decisions in case multiple
 * policies matched. <br />

 * XACML specifies: The Policy Decision Point is used to evaluate access control requests. For further information see
